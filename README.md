Catrin Satchell O'Keeffe Final Project

My final project will be a web app to track study periods and show your study history.
It will consists of:
styles.css for general styling
layout.html which sets out the page layout
index.html where the user inputs the topic they have been studing and how long they studied for
history.html which consists of a table showing previous study periods
application.py where the application is defined
studytopics.db where the historic data is stored
